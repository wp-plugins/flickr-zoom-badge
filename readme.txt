== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is my "Flickr ID"? =

Your Flickr ID is a unique string, that is used internally by Flickr. You can find your own by using e.g. [idgettr](http://idgettr.com/) or [What Is My Flickr ID](http://www.adamwlewis.com/articles/what-is-my-flickr-id).

= Can I change the number of thumbnails? =

Yes, but (for now) you have to edit the plugin file yourself. Near the top, it defines the values flickr_zoom_badge_count (the number of thumbnails in each row/column) and flickr_zoom_badge_size (the size of the thumbnails) -- you can change the values as you see fit, although not all values work well.

= I have translated the plugin into another language, now what? =

Great, thanks! Please do leave a comment on the plugin's homepage
[www.mfd-consult.dk/flickr-zoom-badge](http://www.mfd-consult.dk/flickr-zoom-badge/) or send an e-mail with details; I'll make sure it's included in the next version.

= What's in the pipeline? =

A real roadmap isn't in place, but the following features are currently on the to-do list:
* Configuration of number and size of thumbnails through the widget interface.
